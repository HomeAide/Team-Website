            <p>
                I was introducted to Computer Science by a Math teacher. This just
                so happened to be the one day in class where she was able to 
                provide us with a real world application of the math lesson we 
                were learning about. I eventually ended up going to a technical
                institute while in highschool and I just fell in love with
                the practice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Video games were also what grabbed my attention in computers as 
                well. They were the first thing that really made me question what
                was going on behind the scenes. I even started coming up with
                coding solutions in my head before I ever started to learn
                how to develop them!
            </p>

            <p>
                I would love to get into video game development. Video games have 
                always been a stress and anxiety reliever for me. They have gotten me
                through some of the hardest moments in my life. With my skills
                and knowledge of programming, I feel that I will be able to
                provide the same comfort for the next generation of gamers.

                I currently am employed at a major electronic retail chain. I've
                observed that our elderly crowd always seems the most misinformed
                or uninformed about the technologies that are available to them.
                When they walk into the store and an associate introduces them
                to tech that can help them with their memory problems, their 
                faces glow as they never knew something like that had even existed.
                Moments like that are priceless!
            </p>

            <p>
                It's always been important to me to provide methods or assistance
                to those who may have difficulties in life. I personally do not
                have connection with those with disabilities, and the only problem
                my grandparents have is that they are annoyingly stubborn! But I
                also recognize that certain activites that were once easy are now
                obstacles for them. I feel this is true for most elderly people.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want to use this project as a means of providing methods to 
                people who are having troubles whether it be to their disabilities
                or advancing age. Being able to provide informatoin about the
                technologies that are out their that can help them with the 
                most difficult parts of their lives gives them room to go and 
                do the things that matter the most to them.
