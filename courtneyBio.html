      <h1>Motivations</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I was introducted to Computer Science by a Math teacher. This just
        so happened to be the one day in class where she was able to
        provide us with a real world application of the math lesson we
        were learning about. I eventually ended up going to a technical
        institute while in highschool and I just fell in love with
        the practice.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        Video games were also what grabbed my attention in computers as
        well. They were the first thing that really made me question what
        was going on behind the scenes. I even started coming up with
        coding solutions in my head before I ever started to learn
        how to develop them!
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I would love to get into video game development. Video games have
        always been a stress and anxiety reliever for me. They have gotten me
        through some of the hardest moments in my life. With my skills
        and knowledge of programming, I feel that I will be able to
        provide the same comfort for the next generation of gamers.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I currently am employed at a major electronic retail chain. I've
        observed that our elderly crowd always seems the most misinformed
        or uninformed about the technologies that are available to them.
        When they walk into the store and an associate introduces them
        to tech that can help them with their memory problems, their
        faces glow as they never knew something like that had even existed.
        Moments like that are priceless!
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        It's always been important to me to provide methods or assistance
        to those who may have difficulties in life. I personally do not
        have connection with those with disabilities, and the only problem
        my grandparents have is that they are annoyingly stubborn! But I
        also recognize that certain activites that were once easy are now
        obstacles for them. I feel this is true for most elderly people.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I want to use this project as a means of providing methods to
        people who are having troubles whether it be to their disabilities
        or advancing age. Being able to provide informatoin about the
        technologies that are out their that can help them with the
        most difficult parts of their lives gives them room to go and
        do the things that matter the most to them.
