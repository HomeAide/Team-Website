            <p>
                I was introducted to Computer Science by a Math teacher. This just
                so happened to be the one day in class where she was able to 
                provide us with a real world application of the math lesson we 
                were learning about. I eventually ended up going to a technical
                institute while in highschool and I just fell in love with
                the practice.
            </p>

                Video games were also what grabbed my attention in computers as 
                well. They were the first thing that really made me question what
                was going on behind the scenes. I even started coming up with
                coding solutions in my head before I ever started to learn
                how to develop them!
