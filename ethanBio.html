      <h1>Motivations</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        Computer science was something that I was introduced to in my
        early 20's through a friend who was a computer science major. I
        wasn't happy with my major and took some minor intro courses of
        computer science and found myself to really enjoy that type of
        work. I am also a computer nerd and like to play video games and
        do various things on the computer so it was a fit for me.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I am interested in the field of computer science because it opens
        up a lot of opportunities for me to show what I can do, and it
        requires one to think logically and outside the box which I
        really like challenging my mind with. I also really like creating
        something and seeing it actually work before my eyes which is a
        reason I am in this field.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        When I graduate with my degree I hope to be able to work in app
        developments as I find that to be the most fulfilling and
        satisfying type of work that I have done so far. However I will
        take any job I can get and I also plan on developing my own
        projects on the side.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I chose to be on this project because I have several people in
        my family who could benefit from an app like this so there is a
        lot of motivation for me to work on it as it has direct connection
        to my loved ones. I also chose to work on this project as I get
        to create an app that can help people.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        To me, this project means being able to show my skills and create
        an app that people will use and that will better their lives which
        is really satisfying to me. It means working hard on something
        that means a lot to me personally where I can see my hard work be
        put into action.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        I feel that this project will benefit people because I've
        experienced first hand the struggles that can come with aging
        adults and people with disabilities. I know how hard it can be to
        find tools and methods that can help them in their everyday life
        as I have tried to search for such tools on my own. Having this app
        will make things so much easier to find those tools to help
        people who need it most and will in return make their life
        that much more livable.
