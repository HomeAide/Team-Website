            <h2>Motivations</h2>

            <p>
                I started to become interested in computer science when I was in 
                the 10th grade. I took a few classes that were somewhat related
                to computer science such as graphic design, and webpage design.
                After I graduated from high school, I spent two years over at
                Coconino Community College taking more classes realted to
                computer science such as introduction to programming languages
                and intro to game design. It was around this point that I 
                decided to go father into this field which is when I transferred
                to NAU.

                There is not really an all encompassing reason as to why I like
                computer science; it is rather a mix of several different things.
                One reason I like it is the problem solving aspect. I like the
                idea of being able to try to figure out solutions to problems,
                and come up with new solutions. I also enjoy the variety of 
                options that I could potentially go into that are all related to
                computer science. As well as the fact taht considering the field 
                is constantly changing I will keep learning new things and that
                will make it so nothing ever gets boring.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose to be on this project because I really like the idea of
                helping people with disabilities. While to some extend I do feel
                that any piece of software written for any purpose helps someone
                whether it be just for entertainment, making a job easier, or doing
                something quicker and more efficiently. There is something to be
                said about working on a project that will directly impact people
                who really could use extra help in their day to day lives, and
                working on something that could improve someone's quality of 
                life rather than just alleviate.
            </p>

            <p>
                I feel that this project could benefit people in too many ways
                to list them all here. Just to list a few I think it could help
                people be able to heave an easier way to access assistive
                technology that they coulde use in their own homes, it could
                provide ways for people to implement new strategies that could
                help in their everyday lives. It coudl allow them to achieve
                a higher level of independece and it could allow people to
                stay at their homes with less difficulty and in need of
                assistance from others.
