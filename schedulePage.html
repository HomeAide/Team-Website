            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                The above image shows our intended plan moving forward until the
                end of the Fall 2020 term. This shows the general idea of upcoming
                due dates for when the team intends to complete each of the 
                remaining tasks. Of the remaining tasks, the most important 
                milestone is the tech demo presentation as it is proof of the 
                technologies that have been chosen. To follow along with the 
                completion of the tasks listed in the above schedule, 
                <a href="documents.html#taskreports">see the task reports
                    listed on the documents page!

            </p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                Starting in the Spring 2021 semester, the team plans to have 
                updates to the project about every two weeks. Each of these 
                updates will be run by our client so that we are able to
                continuously improve the end product to meet our client needs.
                Doing so will allow us to get continuous feedback on the 
                progress of the project
            </p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                Some of the anticipated milestones include:
                <ul class="w3-text-grey">
                    <li>User registration/profile creation</li>
                    <li>User can deregister/erase profile</li>
                    <li>User can navigate around a virtual house</li>
                    <li>App gives AT recommendation to user</li>
                    <li>App automatically syncs with database</li>
                    <li>Accessibility options (ie, colorblind mode, text-to-speed)</li>
                    <li>App asks for feedback on past AT recommendations</li>
                    <li>Sending notifications to the app from the database</li>
                    <li>Sending a survey to the app from the database</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">
                These are just a rough idea of major milestones this app will
                achieve during development. More may be added and some may be
                readjusted.

                The above image is the gannt chart showing the plan for development
                for the Spring 2021 semester. It displays a more concrete idea 
                of due dates for development milestones (or modules) for the 
                project. To follow along with the completetion of the tasks

                Development on the mobile application, website, and database 
                began on January 24th, 2021 and is estimated to have a working
                version by March 5th, 2021. This working version means that 
                all modules listed below will be in working order. The remainder
                of March and April will be spent on UI, design, and finishing
                touches to the application.

                Module Breakdown
                <ul class="w3-text-grey">
                    <li>Communication with database</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The initial focus at the beginning of development
                                will be making sure the website and the mobile
                                application can access the database and be able
                                to pull data from it.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>User profiles</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This step will focus on allowing users to be
                                able to make profiles. These profiles will 
                                include their username, passwords, and a list of 
                                any limitations they may be experiencing. This 
                                data will also have to be able to be stored 
                                in the database
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Inventory Management</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Focus here will be spent allowing administrators
                                to manage all of the AT devices stored in the
                                database. They will be able to add, remove, or
                                edit any device in the database.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                This will be the core functionality of the 
                                application that will allow a user to navigate
                                around a virtual home and select rooms. From 
                                here, they can be given any advice or 
                                recommendations if the user may be having
                                difficulties in that room.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Additionally functionality will be added to the 
                                inventory in which the administrators will be 
                                able to search for information contained within
                                the database. Searching parameters can look 
                                by name of the device, the type, or even 
                                what limitations they could assist with.
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This is the algorithm that will consider user 
                                limitations and room difficulties to provide 
                                any AT devices or general advice to assist the 
                                user. It is crucial that the algorithm is able 
                                to access the database and pull information 
                                about AT devices and display to the user.
                            </li>

                                This is more of a sub-module of the above in
                                which advice or any recommended AT devices 
                                will be displayed. This part must be adaptive 
                                in how it is displayed depending on how much 
                                information the user wants to see at a time.

                            <li>
                                Will provide the administrators with the
                                ability to be able to manage other administrators.
                                They will be able to determine the level of 
                                access each administrator will have to the 
                                database.

                                activity will be developed to help make the 
                                database more secure. Accessibility features 
                                will also be added to the mobile application as 
                                well (such as a colorblind mode or 
                                text-to-speech).

                                The appliation will have integration with

                                application that will provide surveys to users
                                about their experience. These responses will be 
                                sent back to the clients where they can 
                                evaluate the data from these surveys.
