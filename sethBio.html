            <p>
                I've been using computers since the days of MS-DOS, B drives, 
                and "insert disk 2 of 4 to continue..."
                At one time I ran my own web server in my apartment closet.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy the problem-solving involved in Computer Science and
                learning how things work "under the hood."
            </p>

            <p>
                My main interest is in working abroad, and I would like a career
                that is both fast-paced and dynamic.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project was my first pick because it involved assistive
                technology. Having the opportunity to help people makes this 
                project rewarding.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've worked on multiple other projects with Disability Resources
                because I want to help people live better. I hope that this
                project will help to connect assistive technologies with the 
                people who might use them to improve their lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project is about connecting the thousands of currently 
                available and future assistive technologies with people who
                may not even know about them.
