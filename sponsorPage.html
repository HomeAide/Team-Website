        <p>
            The modern Age of Technology has created an abundance of technology.
            There are more devices out there with a wide range of features that
            most people are unaware of. These days, it is very common to name off
            devices made by Amazon, Google, Apple, or Samsung. But, devices made
            by these manufactures might not have the features that some require.
            And some people may not know what kinds of features these devices
            even offer.
        </p>

        <p>
            A major concern that comes with a disconnect with the technologies 
            on the market is that helpful technologies are left unaware by 
            people who may need them. The elderly and those with disabilities
            have difficulties that can be remedied or assisted with by these
            technologies. If only they knew that they existed!
        </p>

        <p>
            This project is all about helping bridge this disconnect and providing
            information about these technologies to those who can benefit from
            them. Not only will users be informed about popular brands, they will
            also be informed about some of the less popular brands. The goal is 
            to help provide users with technologies that are a best fit for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            A mobile application will be the approach for this particular problem.
            The app will utilize a database that will contain information about
            various technologies and the features that they have to offer. This
            database will be updated frequently as new technologies become
            available, or technologies update to include more features. Users will
            input activities that are the most difficult for them. Based upon 
            this information, the app will access this database and determine
            what kind of assistive technologies will help them with their
            difficulties.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is critical that this app be accessible to all people regardless
            of disability. The app will include features such as a colorblind 
            mode or text-to-speech to provide accessibility. However, based upon  
            the type or severity of a user's difficulties, they may not need 
            additional technology! The app itself will also be able to provide
            advise and tips that can assist the user with their troubles!
